# software-re-ideas
A repository of possible research path for RE applied to software. These are supposed to be in development, draft, but also potentially ready to be picked.

There are 3 additional directories. 
1. `published` contain ideas that have already gotten paper published from it. That does not mean you cannot add to it or take it for more work on it. But we want to separate stuff that are being explored from stuff that actually got worked on.
2. `nursery` is where you will find rough ideas. These are open for taking, but the community consider them a bit too early or under explored to bring them to the visible part.
3. `in_progress` contains ideas and study that have been picked up and are actively researched. As with the others, that does not mean you cannot participate or use them. But it may be useful to contact the people working on it.

## I want to add something or expand one of them

Feel free to open a PR! Every one of them also has an associated issue linked at the top, which is where the discussion around contributing to it happen. This is also where you can get mentoring or help to contribute if you are interested.

## I got an idea, can i add it?

TODO: add a template PR for new one. Add automation to open related issue when new one merged.

Yes please! open a PR with your idea written in the document. It can be as simple as a single line of description with the rest of the template empty. We welcome all new ideas!

## I think this idea is bad, i want to tell the author they are dumb!

Don't do that. We welcome pushback and feedback, but this repository follows the LFI CoC. We _will enforce it_. This is a community that strive to be accessible and open.

## All that process sound really complex and scary. I probably do not belong here

You probably do belong here. We acknowledge that this field can feel daunting and advanced. We appreciate and eagerly welcome newcomers from all path of life and layers of knowledge and experience. Please come ask for help in the issues. There is a pinned issue to ask for help and we will be happy to find ways to support you.

TODO: create and pin that issue
TODO: add tables of ideas at the different stage with important information. Automate its updates
